# Requirements

## ==Operating System==

Hydra requires MacOS 10.15 (Catalina) or higher. All current versions run on MacOS 13 (Ventura)

## ==Python==

All algorithms and UI components are written in Python3 and the current Hydra environment uses Python 3.10.4.

## ==Data access and format==

Currently, Hydra accepts both .wav and .flac file types. Hydra processes data after it is stored on disk with a path that uniquely identifies its location in a directory structure. 

## ==Data storage==
	
Hydra data products requires 1-10 GB of storage space for each hydrophone per year.
